# To-Do List App

This project is part of the Codevixens 10 Days of Frontend Challenge (Day 7). This To-Do List application was built using Vite React and styled with TailwindCSS. The task focuses on mastering  state management, event handling, and list rendering in ReactJS.

## Features

- **State Management:** React's **useState**  hook were used to manage input value and list of to-do items.
- **Event Handling:** Handles the add button to add new todo item.
- **User Interface:** Simple UI that dislays new to-do and completed to-do tasks.
